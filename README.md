**Analysis & Insights**
Project Outcome Overview

The pie chart summarizes the overall count and value of awarded versus dropped projects. A higher total value of dropped projects signals potential areas for improving client conversion strategies and addressing reasons for project loss.

Client Type Contribution

A bar chart breaks down the project count and value by client type. Direct clients represent the largest share of awarded project value, indicating that focusing on direct client relationships can drive revenue growth. Architect and PMC projects have lower values, suggesting a need to strengthen engagement or reposition offerings in these categories.

Sector Performance

Sector analysis through a donut chart shows which industries contribute most to the awarded projects. Retail and hotel sectors appear as significant contributors, indicating strong market presence and opportunity for targeted growth. Commercial and residential sectors may require additional focus to enhance project acquisition.

Revenue Trends by Year

The bottom bar chart outlines the awarded project value over the years. This helps identify which years were peak periods and which sectors or client types were most profitable during those times. The organization can use this to strengthen focus areas that are currently in a low stage and aim to replicate past successes.

**Business Value & Strategic Use**

This dashboard equips decision-makers with a clear view of long-term performance trends, helping them make informed decisions on which sectors to strengthen and which client types to target more effectively. It also highlights areas for process improvement and future business development.
